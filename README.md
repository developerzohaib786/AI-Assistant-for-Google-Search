# AI Assistant for Google Search

This project demonstrates an AI-powered assistant that interacts with users through voice commands and responds using speech synthesis. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, and the Web Speech API, and provides the user with various capabilities like opening websites, fetching information, and performing simple tasks.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: The assistant listens to voice commands and processes them accordingly.
- **Speech Synthesis**: The assistant responds with a voice to the user, providing feedback and interacting naturally.
- **Web Search**: It can search Google or Wikipedia based on user queries.
- **Website Navigation**: The assistant can open popular websites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
- **Time & Date**: The assistant can provide the current time and date.
- **Calculator**: It can open the system calculator based on voice commands.
  
## How it Works

The AI Assistant uses the Web Speech API to recognize the user's voice input and generate speech output. It listens for specific voice commands, processes them, and executes actions such as opening websites, performing Google searches, or providing information about the current time or date.

### Key Components:
- **SpeechRecognition API**: Used to recognize voice commands.
- **SpeechSynthesis API**: Converts text to speech and lets the assistant respond vocally.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Implements the functionality of the assistant, interpreting commands and performing actions.

### Example Commands:
- "Open Google"
- "Open YouTube"
- "What is the time?"
- "Who is Albert Einstein?"
- "Open Wikipedia"
- "Open Facebook"
- "Calculator"
